## File I/O Example in C++

This simple C++ program demonstrates how to perform basic file input and output operations using the Standard C++ Library. It includes writing text to a file and reading text from a file.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

You need a C++ compiler to build and run this program. If you don't have one installed, you can download and install one like [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

### Or Use IDE
1. Download and install CodeBlocks or any C++ IDE if you do not already have it installed.
2. Download the main.cpp file.
3. Add it to your C++ project.
4. Run the project application.


### Code Explanation
This program performs two basic file operations: writing to a file and reading from a file. Here's a brief overview of what each part of the code does:

1. It includes the necessary C++ standard library headers.

2. The program begins in the main() function.

3. It defines a filename (example.txt) for the file operations.

4. Writing to a File:

    * It opens an output file stream (ofstream) and checks if the file can be opened.
    * If successful, it writes "Hello, World!" and "This is an example file." to the file, then closes it.
5. Reading from a File:

    * It opens an input file stream (ifstream) and checks if the file can be opened.
    * If successful, it reads the contents of the file line by line and displays them to the console.
6. The program returns 0, indicating successful execution.
